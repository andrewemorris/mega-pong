## Description

This project uses CSS, html and JavaScript to create a bouncing ball game. There are two sets of balls, each set has a different colour. The aim of the game is to make all the balls the same colour. Clicking on a ball of the minority colour changes its colour to match the majority colour. If all of the balls match then you've won! But if you click on a ball of the majority colour then you lose! Try adding or removing balls to make it more or less challenging.
